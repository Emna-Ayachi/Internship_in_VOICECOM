# Internship_in_VOICECOM
This repository contains all the work I completed and tested during my internship. It includes:
-Cleaning and processing a large real-world dataset
-Comparing the performance and usability of Polars vs. Pandas, and spaCy vs. NLTK
-Building three different machine learning models from a single dataset

Throughout this internship, I gained valuable insights into the field of machine learning. I learned the importance of experimentation over assumptionsâ€”rather than relying solely on online opinions, I explored different tools and frameworks myself. Each library or framework has its strengths and unique features, and understanding them firsthand has been eye-opening.
I also developed strong skills in data manipulation and cleaning, and learned how to evaluate whether a dataset is suitable for model training. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of the mathematical foundations of machine learning, including:

-Activation functions
-Loss functions
-Hidden layers
-Learning rate tuning
-Train-test splitting

This hands-on experience has significantly improved both my practical and theoretical understanding of machine learning.
